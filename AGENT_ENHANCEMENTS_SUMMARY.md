# Cognitive Analysis Agent Enhancements

## Overview
Incorporated key learnings from analysis sessions into the cognitive analysis agent to improve data quality validation, feature engineering, performance analysis, and provide comprehensive improvement recommendations.

## Key Enhancements Added

### 1. Enhanced Data Quality Validation (`_validate_data_quality`)
- **Gender coding validation**: Checks for proper coding (0=Male, 1=Female) per data dictionary
- **Age calculation validation**: Ensures proper age calculation using Age_Baseline + TimepointCode
- **MemTrax filtering validation**: Verifies Ashford filter application (Status == 'Collected', CorrectPCT >= 0.60, RT in [0.5, 2.5])
- **Data dictionary consistency**: Validates against authoritative data dictionary
- **Comprehensive warnings and recommendations**: Provides specific guidance for data quality issues

### 2. Advanced Feature Engineering (`_engineer_advanced_features`)
- **Hit RT vs All-Click RT**: Uses hit-only RTs for sequence features to avoid diluting signal
- **Age normalization**: Creates age-bin normalized z-scores to isolate cognitive signal from age effects
- **Signal Detection Theory features**: Adds d_prime and criterion_c for additional signal beyond raw accuracy
- **Speed-accuracy tradeoff features**: Creates speed-accuracy product and ratio features
- **Education-accuracy interactions**: Adds interaction features between education and cognitive performance
- **Device/browser context**: One-hot encodes device types, operating systems, languages
- **Composite cognitive scores**: Creates RT/(accuracy+0.01) type features

### 3. Performance Plateau Detection (`_detect_performance_plateau`)
- **Plateau pattern recognition**: Detects AUC plateau around 0.755-0.760 range
- **Diminishing returns analysis**: Identifies when feature engineering shows minimal improvement
- **Evidence-based detection**: Uses multiple indicators to determine plateau confidence
- **Comprehensive recommendations**: Provides specific next steps when plateau is detected

### 4. Comprehensive Improvement Recommendations (`_generate_improvement_recommendations`)
- **Data quality improvements**: Baseline-only selection, gender coding validation, proper age calculation
- **Feature engineering improvements**: Hit RT usage, age normalization, SDT features, within-test dynamics
- **Model improvements**: Traditional ML preference, hyperparameter optimization, ensemble methods
- **Technical improvements**: Data dictionary validation, environment management, performance optimization
- **Performance-based next steps**: Tailored recommendations based on current AUC performance

### 5. Integration with Existing Methods
- **Enhanced data loading**: Applies validation and feature engineering during data loading
- **Performance ceiling integration**: Incorporates plateau detection into existing ceiling analysis
- **Analysis pipeline integration**: Adds improvement recommendations as Step 8 in analysis pipeline
- **Comprehensive logging**: Provides detailed warnings and recommendations throughout the process

## Technical Implementation Details

### Data Quality Validation
```python
def _validate_data_quality(self, data: pd.DataFrame) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # Validates gender coding, age calculation, MemTrax filtering, data dictionary consistency
    # Returns comprehensive validation results with warnings and recommendations
```

### Advanced Feature Engineering
```python
def _engineer_advanced_features(self, data: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    # Implements hit RT vs all-click RT, age normalization, SDT features
    # Creates speed-accuracy tradeoffs, education interactions, device context
    # Returns enhanced DataFrame with additional features
```

### Performance Analysis
```python
def _detect_performance_plateau(self, model_results: Dict[str, float], 
                               feature_counts: List[int]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # Detects plateau patterns around 0.755-0.760 AUC
    # Provides evidence-based plateau detection with confidence scores
    # Returns comprehensive recommendations for next steps
```

## Key Learnings Incorporated

### 1. Data Quality Issues
- Gender coding discrepancy (0=Male, 1=Female vs 1=Male, 2=Female)
- Age calculation complexity with multiple methods
- MemTrax data filtering requirements (Ashford criteria)
- Data dictionary as authoritative source

### 2. Feature Engineering Insights
- Hit RT vs All-Click RT distinction for sequence features
- Age normalization importance for isolating cognitive signal
- SDT features (d_prime, criterion_c) provide additional signal
- Per-item trajectory lost in mean aggregation

### 3. Model Performance Patterns
- AUC plateau around 0.755-0.760 despite feature additions
- Top predictive features: education-accuracy interactions, speed-accuracy products
- Baseline vs longitudinal data considerations

### 4. Technical Implementation Lessons
- Permutation importance as major bottleneck
- Environment management for package installation
- Data dictionary validation importance

### 5. Improvement Opportunities
- Within-test dynamics and per-item response patterns
- Cross-session stability analysis
- Device/browser context features
- Model tuning and ensemble methods
- Label quality validation

## Usage

The enhanced agent automatically applies these improvements during analysis:

```python
# Initialize agent
agent = CognitiveAnalysisAgent()

# Run analysis (automatically applies enhancements)
results = agent.run_complete_analysis()

# Access improvement recommendations
recommendations = results['improvement_recommendations']
print("Data Quality Improvements:", recommendations['data_quality_improvements'])
print("Feature Engineering Improvements:", recommendations['feature_engineering_improvements'])
print("Next Steps:", recommendations['next_steps'])
```

## Benefits

1. **Proactive Data Quality**: Catches common data issues before they affect analysis
2. **Enhanced Feature Engineering**: Leverages learnings to create more informative features
3. **Performance Awareness**: Recognizes when further optimization may not be beneficial
4. **Comprehensive Guidance**: Provides specific, actionable recommendations for improvement
5. **Learning Integration**: Incorporates domain expertise and analysis patterns automatically

## Future Enhancements

- Implement within-test dynamics analysis for MemTrax data
- Add cross-session stability analysis
- Create automated data quality reports
- Implement performance monitoring and alerting
- Add more sophisticated plateau detection algorithms
