# Agent Leakage Detection Learnings

## New Capabilities Added to Cognitive Analysis Agent

Based on our systematic investigation of data leakage in cognitive impairment prediction, we've embedded several key learnings into the agent:

### 1. **Enhanced Leakage Detection**
- **Automatic detection** of cognitive assessment features when predicting cognitive impairment
- **Warning system** for potential leakage sources:
  - ECOG/SP-ECOG features (informant reports)
  - Medical history features when predicting medical conditions
  - Informant reports when predicting self-reported conditions
  - Temporal features that may leak future information

### 2. **Performance Ceiling Guidance**
- **Realistic performance expectations**: AUC >0.85 in cognitive impairment prediction may indicate leakage
- **Realistic ceiling for self-reported labels**: 0.75-0.80 AUC
- **Automatic warnings** when performance seems too high for the data characteristics

### 3. **Feature Quality Insights**
- **Cognitive assessment features can hurt performance** by introducing noise
- **Different constructs**: Cognitive assessments (subjective/functional) vs objective performance tests
- **Recommendation**: Remove cognitive assessment features to improve performance

### 4. **Methodology Validation**
- **Automatic verification** of no data leakage between training and testing
- **Feature name analysis** to detect problematic feature-target relationships
- **Risk level assessment** (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH) for potential leakage

## Key Learnings from BHR MemTrax Analysis

### **Performance Progression:**
- **With leakage**: 0.8532 AUC (ECOG/SP-ECOG features included)
- **Without leakage**: 0.7559 AUC (MemTrax + demographics only)
- **Improvement**: Removing cognitive assessment features actually **improved** performance

### **Why This Happened:**
1. **Different constructs**: ECOG/SP-ECOG measure subjective daily functioning, MemTrax measures objective memory performance
2. **Limited overlap**: Only 14.9% of subjects had both assessments
3. **Noise introduction**: Cognitive assessment features added noise rather than signal
4. **Domain mismatch**: Subjective reports don't correlate well with objective performance

### **Agent Recommendations:**
- **For cognitive impairment prediction**: Use only objective performance measures + demographics
- **Avoid**: Cognitive assessment features, medical history features, informant reports
- **Focus on**: Data quality, proper methodology, realistic performance expectations

## Implementation Details

The agent now automatically:
1. **Scans feature names** for potential leakage indicators
2. **Warns about high performance** that may indicate leakage
3. **Recommends feature removal** when appropriate
4. **Provides realistic performance expectations** based on data characteristics
5. **Validates methodology** to ensure honest evaluation

This makes the agent much smarter about detecting and preventing data leakage in future analyses, ensuring more reliable and honest performance metrics.
