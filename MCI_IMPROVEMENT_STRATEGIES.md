# Strategies to Improve MCI Prediction Beyond 0.744 AUC

## Current Situation
- **Best AUC**: 0.744 (with proper ML methodology)
- **Dataset**: BHR cohort (70%+ college educated, 5.9% MCI prevalence)
- **Key Barrier**: Cognitive reserve masking impairment in educated population

## 1. Fix the Label Problem (Most Promising)

### A. Multi-Source Label Validation
```python
# Combine self-report + objective performance + informant
def create_validated_labels():
    # Require 2 of 3 sources to agree:
    # 1. Self-reported cognitive complaints (QIDs)
    # 2. Objective impairment (MemTrax < threshold)
    # 3. Informant report (SP-ECOG > threshold)
    
    # This reduces "worried well" false positives
    # And catches anosognosia cases
```

### B. Clinical Outcome Labels
- Instead of subjective complaints, use:
  - Clinical diagnosis codes if available
  - Progression to dementia within 2-3 years
  - Medication prescriptions (cholinesterase inhibitors)
  - Healthcare utilization patterns

### C. Continuous Target Instead of Binary
- Model MCI severity as continuous score
- Use regression then threshold for classification
- Captures subtle differences better

## 2. Feature Engineering Breakthroughs

### A. Intra-Individual Variability
```python
def extract_variability_features(memtrax):
    # Within-test variability
    features['rt_iqr'] = percentile_75 - percentile_25
    features['response_entropy'] = calculate_entropy(responses)
    
    # Trial-to-trial variability
    features['rt_autocorrelation'] = autocorr(reaction_times)
    features['consistency_index'] = 1 / coefficient_of_variation
```

### B. Domain-Specific Cognitive Scores
```python
def compute_domain_scores():
    # Memory: Recognition hits - false alarms
    # Executive: Task-switching cost
    # Processing speed: Simple RT percentile
    # Attention: Sustained attention metrics
```

### C. Residualized Cognitive Scores
```python
# Remove expected performance for demographics
def residualize_cognition(scores, age, education):
    expected = predict_normal_performance(age, education)
    residual = scores - expected
    return residual  # Negative = worse than expected
```

## 3. Advanced Modeling Approaches

### A. Ensemble with Domain Expertise
```python
# Different models for different aspects
models = {
    'memory_model': trained_on_memory_features,
    'executive_model': trained_on_executive_features,
    'speed_model': trained_on_processing_speed
}
# Meta-learner combines domain predictions
```

### B. Semi-Supervised Learning
```python
# Use unlabeled data to learn representations
from sklearn.semi_supervised import LabelPropagation

# Propagate labels to similar unlabeled subjects
# Increases effective sample size
```

### C. Cost-Sensitive Learning
```python
# Heavily penalize missing true MCI cases
class_weight = {
    0: 1,      # Normal
    1: 10      # MCI (high cost of missing)
}
```

## 4. Data Integration Fixes

### A. Subject ID Harmonization
```python
# Fix SP-ECOG matching issue
def harmonize_subject_ids():
    # Check for ID format differences
    # Try fuzzy matching
    # Map between different ID systems
```

### B. Temporal Alignment
```python
# Ensure features and labels from same timepoint
def align_temporally():
    # Match MemTrax tests to closest medical assessment
    # Use time windows (e.g., Â±3 months)
```

## 5. Population-Specific Strategies

### A. Education-Stratified Models
```python
# Separate models for education levels
if education > 16:
    model = high_education_model  # Different features matter
else:
    model = standard_model
```

### B. Age-Specific Thresholds
```python
# Age-adjusted performance norms
thresholds = {
    '65-70': {'RT': 1.2, 'accuracy': 0.75},
    '70-75': {'RT': 1.4, 'accuracy': 0.70},
    '75+':   {'RT': 1.6, 'accuracy': 0.65}
}
```

## 6. External Data Integration

### A. Biomarkers (if available)
- APOE genotype
- Blood-based markers (p-tau, NfL)
- Imaging features (hippocampal volume)

### B. Digital Biomarkers
- Typing patterns
- Mouse movement trajectories
- Response time distributions

### C. Lifestyle Factors
- Physical activity
- Sleep patterns
- Social engagement

## 7. Validation Strategy Improvements

### A. Temporal Validation
```python
# Train on early years, test on later
train_data = data[data['year'] <= 2018]
test_data = data[data['year'] > 2018]
```

### B. Cross-Cohort Validation
- Train on BHR
- Validate on ADNI or other public dataset
- Shows generalization

## 8. Quick Wins (Easiest to Implement)

### 1. **Optimize Decision Threshold**
```python
# Don't use default 0.5
# Find optimal threshold for F1 or sensitivity
optimal_threshold = find_threshold_for_sensitivity(0.80)
```

### 2. **Feature Selection**
```python
# Use RFECV to find optimal features
from sklearn.feature_selection import RFECV
selector = RFECV(estimator, cv=5, scoring='roc_auc')
```

### 3. **Hyperparameter Optimization**
```python
# Systematic grid search
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
param_grid = {
    'C': [0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10],
    'penalty': ['l1', 'l2', 'elasticnet']
}
```

## Expected Impact

| Strategy | Difficulty | Expected AUC Gain | Timeline |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|----------|
| Fix labels | Medium | +0.03-0.05 | 1 week |
| Residualization | Easy | +0.02-0.03 | 2 days |
| Semi-supervised | Hard | +0.02-0.04 | 2 weeks |
| Stratified models | Medium | +0.02-0.03 | 1 week |
| External data | Hard | +0.05-0.10 | 1 month |
| Optimize threshold | Easy | +0.01-0.02 | 1 day |

## Recommended Priority

1. **Fix subject ID matching** for SP-ECOG (could unlock informant data)
2. **Create validated composite labels** (reduce noise)
3. **Implement residualized scores** (remove demographic effects)
4. **Build education-stratified models** (handle cognitive reserve)
5. **Add semi-supervised learning** (leverage unlabeled data)

## Realistic Target

With 2-3 of these improvements:
- **Achievable**: 0.78-0.80 AUC
- **Stretch**: 0.82-0.85 AUC (with external data)

## Key Insight

The 0.80 barrier exists because:
1. **Label noise** from subjective reports
2. **Cognitive reserve** masking in educated cohort
3. **Missing informant data**

Fixing ANY of these could push us over 0.80!
