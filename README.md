## üß† Framework Capabilities: Multi-Modal Cognitive Assessment

This framework automatically discovers and analyzes relationships across any combination of:
- **Self-Report Measures**: ECOG, CDR, MoCA questionnaires  
- **Digital Assessments**: MemTrax, NIH Toolbox, custom cognitive tests
- **Clinical Data**: Demographics, medical history, medications
- **Biomarker Data**: CSF, plasma, imaging results (extensible)

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Generalization Principles

### **Intelligent Multi-Agent System**

1. **Discovery Agent** (`agents/discovery_agent.py`)
   - **Autonomous Dataset Characterization**: Automatically discovers and maps any cognitive assessment data
   - **Intelligent Variable Mapping**: Uses domain ontologies to identify assessment types (ECOG, MemTrax, MoCA, etc.)
   - **Quality Assessment**: Applies clinical research standards for data completeness and validity

2. **Cognitive Analysis Agent** (`agents/cognitive_analysis_agent.py`)  
   - **Pure AI Analysis**: No hardcoded rules - all insights generated through advanced AI reasoning
   - **Multi-modal Integration**: Discovers relationships across any combination of cognitive measures
   - **Clinical Significance**: Interprets statistical findings through Alzheimer's research expertise
   - **Biomarker Discovery**: Identifies novel patterns using domain-informed AI analysis
   - **Methodological Learning**: Incorporates data processing principles from domain expertise while remaining dataset-agnostic

3. **Literature Research Agent** (`agents/literature_agent.py`)
   - **Expert Literature Search**: Uses domain-specific search strategies across PubMed and Semantic Scholar
   - **Intelligent Synthesis**: AI-powered extraction of relevant findings and effect sizes
   - **Novelty Detection**: Compares current findings against existing research to identify contributions

4. **AI Orchestrator** (`core/orchestrator.py`)
   - **Agentic Coordination**: Manages multi-agent workflow with AI-powered decision making
   - **Expert Synthesis**: Generates research-quality insights by combining all agent findings
   - **Human-Readable Summaries**: AI translates complex findings into clear clinical implications

### **Dataset Adapters (Pluggable Loaders)**
- Adapters live in `core/datasets/` and encapsulate dataset-specific loading/cleaning.
- Current adapters:
  - `OasisAdapter` for OASIS cross-sectional/longitudinal (`training_data/oasis/`)
  - `BrfssAdapter` for BRFSS surveillance CSVs (`dataset.file_patterns`)
  - `GenericCSVAdapter` for simple CSV files (e.g., Kaggle datasets)
- The agent automatically selects an adapter based on `config.dataset.name` and on-disk availability, with a safe fallback to legacy OASIS loading.

### **Generalization Principles: Learning Methods, Not Data**

The framework incorporates domain expertise through **methodological principles** rather than dataset-specific hardcoding:

#### **Universal Data Processing Patterns**
```python
# Generalized filtering (not dataset-specific)
if 'Status' in df.columns:
    df = df[df['Status'] == 'Collected']  # Universal quality filter

# Pattern-based variable discovery (configurable)
memtrax_vars = [col for col in df.columns 
                if any(pattern in col.lower() 
                      for pattern in ['reaction_time', 'correctpct', 'accuracy'])]
```

#### **Standard Medical Coding Integration**
- **QID Medical Codes**: Uses standard medical classification (QID1-5: Dementia, QID1-12: Alzheimer's, etc.)
- **Assessment Patterns**: Recognizes common cognitive assessment structures across datasets
- **Clinical Variables**: Identifies demographics, medical history, and outcomes using healthcare standards

#### **Configuration-Driven Intelligence**
```yaml
# Dataset-agnostic variable patterns
target_variables:
  cognitive_performance: ["accuracy", "reaction_time", "correct_pct"]
  clinical_status: ["diagnosis", "cognitive_status", "mci", "dementia"]
  quality_indicators: ["status", "validity_flag", "completed"]
```

#### **Adaptive Processing Logic**
- **Smart Data Type Detection**: Automatically identifies and converts numeric, categorical, and date variables
- **Quality Validation**: Applies clinical research standards (valid ranges, completeness thresholds)
- **Scale Management**: Handles datasets from hundreds to millions of records through intelligent sampling
- **Assessment Discovery**: Recognizes cognitive test patterns regardless of specific implementation
- **Cartesian Join Protection**: Advanced merge safety system prevents data explosion from duplicate records
- **Intelligent Deduplication**: Automatically removes duplicate subjects using timestamp-based or completeness-based strategies

### **Expert Knowledge Systems**

- **Domain Ontologies** (`config/data_dictionary.json`)
  - **Cognitive Assessment Library**: ECOG, MemTrax, MoCA, CDR, and custom assessments
  - **Statistical Standards**: Effect size thresholds, power analysis parameters, clinical significance criteria
  - **Research Methodology**: Multi-modal assessment best practices, biomarker discovery protocols
  - **Extensible Framework**: Easily add new cognitive domains and assessment types

- **AI-Powered Infrastructure**
  - **Token Manager** (`core/token_manager.py`): Multi-provider AI usage optimization and cost control
  - **Configuration System** (`config/`): Expert-curated research parameters and domain knowledge
  - **Pure AI Analysis**: No fallback rules - all insights generated through domain-informed AI reasoning

### **How We Ensure Generalizability**

#### **Learning from Domain Expertise Without Overfitting**
The system incorporates insights from experienced researchers' analysis scripts, but abstracts them into **universal principles**:

1. **Data Quality Patterns**: 
   - "Filter to collected/valid assessments" becomes a configurable quality check
   - "Convert key performance variables to numeric" becomes automatic type detection
   - "Remove invalid dates/outliers" becomes configurable validation rules

2. **Variable Recognition Logic**:
   - Instead of hardcoding "CorrectPCT", we search for patterns: `["accuracy", "correct_pct", "percent_correct"]`
   - Instead of specific column names, we use semantic categories: `cognitive_performance`, `clinical_outcomes`
   - Medical codes (QID1-x) are recognized as standard healthcare classifications, not dataset-specific

3. **Assessment-Agnostic Processing**:
   ```python
   # Generalizable: Works with any cognitive assessment
   for assessment_type in discovered_assessments:
       variables = find_variables_by_pattern(assessment_type.patterns)
       quality_filter = apply_quality_standards(variables)
       analysis_results = ai_analyze_relationships(quality_filter)
   
   # NOT: Hardcoded for specific tests
   # ecog_scores = df['ECOG_Total']  # Too specific!
   # memtrax_rt = df['CorrectResponsesRT']  # Won't work with other datasets!
   ```

#### **Configuration-Based Adaptation**
New datasets require only **configuration updates**, not code changes:
- Update `file_patterns` to match your file naming
- Add your variable names to `target_variables` patterns  
- Specify any custom quality criteria
- The AI agents handle the rest automatically

This approach ensures the framework benefits from domain expertise while remaining **truly generalizable** to any Alzheimer's research dataset worldwide.

### **Production-Grade Data Safety**

#### **Cartesian Join Protection System**
Real-world datasets often contain duplicate records, multiple timepoints, and inconsistent subject IDs. Our advanced merge safety system prevents catastrophic data explosions:

```python
# Early Warning System
‚ö†Ô∏è CARTESIAN JOIN RISK: Potential 7,397,690,978,650,471,200 record combinations
üí° Using inner joins to reduce risk, but verify subject ID consistency

# Automatic Risk Detection
üö® HIGH DUPLICATION RISK: 72.5% duplication could cause Cartesian joins
üìä Deduplicating cognitive_data: 181,855 ‚Üí 50,101 records
‚úÖ Deduplication by most recent timestamp

# Safe Results
‚úÖ Final dataset: 38,948 subjects (prevented 32M+ record explosion)
```

#### **Intelligent Data Processing**
- **Duplicate Detection**: Identifies and warns about high duplication rates (>50%)
- **Smart Deduplication**: Uses timestamp-based or data completeness strategies
- **Growth Monitoring**: Detects suspicious merge growth patterns (>10x = error, >2x = warning)
- **Graceful Failures**: Clear error messages with diagnostic information for troubleshooting
- **Memory Protection**: Prevents system crashes from runaway memory usage

#### **Real-World Dataset Handling**
The system safely processes complex datasets with:
- **Multiple timepoints per subject** (longitudinal studies)
- **Duplicate records** (data collection artifacts)  
- **Inconsistent subject IDs** (data integration challenges)
- **Large-scale data** (200K+ records, millions of data points)
- **Missing data patterns** (real-world clinical data)

#### **Validation Before Analysis**
```
üìä Pre-merge validation:
   cognitive_data: 50,101 unique subjects, 181,855 total records
   ‚ö†Ô∏è 131,754 duplicate subjects (72.5% duplication rate)
   ecog_data: 52,900 unique subjects, 227,737 total records  
   ‚ö†Ô∏è 174,837 duplicate subjects (76.8% duplication rate)
```

This **production-grade robustness** ensures the framework works reliably with messy real-world data that would crash traditional analysis pipelines.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Guide

### Using OASIS (Default Configuration)

The system comes pre-configured for OASIS analysis. Just download the data and run!

### Using Your Own Dataset

Option A: Place a CSV in the repository (e.g., `alzheimers_disease_data.csv`) and update `config/config.yaml`:
```yaml
dataset:
  name: "Generic_CSV_Kaggle"
  description: "Rabie El Kharoua 2024: Alzheimer's Disease Dataset (Kaggle)"
  data_sources:
    - path: "./alzheimers_disease_data.csv"
      type: "local_file"
  file_patterns:
    generic_csv:
      - "alzheimers_disease_data.csv"
```
Then run:
```bash
python run_analysis.py
```

Option B: Place files in a folder and use patterns:
```yaml
dataset:
  name: "Generic_CSV_Folder"
  data_sources:
    - path: "./training_data/kaggle_ad/"
      type: "local_directory"
  file_patterns:
    generic_csv:
      - "*.csv"
```

Tips:
- If the dataset has known target columns (e.g., diagnosis, MMSE), add them to `experiment.target_variables` for better mapping.
- The `GenericCSVAdapter` will load the CSV(s) and the agents will attempt intelligent variable discovery and analysis.

### Variable Mapping

Variables are mapped using the data dictionary (`config/data_dictionary.json`):

```json
{
  "variable_mappings": {
    "cognitive_assessments": {
      "memtrax_reaction_time": {
        "possible_names": [
          "CorrectResponsesRT", "ResponseTime", "reaction_time"
        ],
        "description": "Reaction time for correct responses",
        "valid_range": [0.3, 3.0]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Token Management

Control AI API usage in `config/usage_limits.json`:

```json
{
  "claude": {
    "daily_token_limit": 1000000,
    "monthly_cost_limit": 1000.0,
    "enabled": true
  }
}

### Common Issues

**"No data files found"**
- Check `data_sources` path in `config/config.yaml`
- Verify file naming patterns match `file_patterns`
- Ensure files are in CSV format
- Confirm the path exists and contains data files

**"Token limit exceeded"**
- Check usage with token manager
- Adjust limits in `config/usage_limits.json`
- Consider using different AI provider

**"Variable mapping failed"**
- Review variable names in your dataset
- Update `config/data_dictionary.json`
- Add custom variable mappings

**"Cartesian join detected" / Data explosion**
```
üö® CRITICAL ERROR: Cartesian join detected!
üìä Data explosion: 181,855 ‚Üí 32,404,889 records (178.1x growth)
```
- **Cause**: Duplicate subject IDs or multiple timepoints per subject
- **Solution**: System automatically deduplicates, but verify your subject ID column
- **Prevention**: Check data structure before analysis - look for multiple records per subject

**"HIGH DUPLICATION RISK" warnings**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è 131,754 duplicate subjects (72.5% duplication rate)
üö® HIGH DUPLICATION RISK: 72.5% duplication could cause Cartesian joins
```
- **Normal for longitudinal studies**: Multiple timepoints create "duplicates"
- **System response**: Automatic deduplication by most recent timestamp
- **Action needed**: Usually none - system handles this automatically
- **Manual override**: Set `use_sampling: true` if you need smaller datasets

**"Very few matches found" warnings**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Very few matches found: 1,234 records from 50,000
üí° This may indicate mismatched subject IDs between datasets
```
- **Cause**: Subject ID inconsistencies between datasets (e.g., "SUBJ001" vs "1")
- **Solution**: Check subject ID column names and formats across your datasets
- **Common fix**: Standardize subject ID formats before analysis

**"Misleading subject counts" / Discovery vs Analysis mismatch**
```
üìä DATASET OVERVIEW: Files analyzed: 6, Total subjects: 1,000
üß† ANALYSIS PHASE: Subjects analyzed: 38,948
```
- **Cause**: Discovery was using sampling (1,000 rows) while analysis used full datasets
- **Fix**: Framework now uses `full_analysis: true` by default for accurate discovery
- **Override**: Set `discovery.full_analysis: false` if you need faster discovery on very large datasets

**Out of memory / System killed**
- **Modern protection**: Updated system prevents memory explosions with Cartesian join detection
- **Legacy issues**: Update to latest version with automatic deduplication
- **Very large datasets**: Disable full discovery: `discovery.full_analysis: false`
